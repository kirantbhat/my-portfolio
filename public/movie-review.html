<h3>The Diplomat</h3>
<p>After a long time, I came across a fabulous movie released in theaters and now on Netflix. The Diplomat is an extremely well made film based on a true story. John Abraham heads the cast and for once nails his performance. He looks suave, smart and handsome and emotes beautifully.
The surprise of the movie is Sadia Khateeb, the leading lady, who does full justice to a role of a lifetime. Not only does she look beautiful, her expressions, get-up and dialogue delivery is outstanding.</p>
<h3>Jewel Thief - The Heist Begins</h3>
<p>Jewel Thief is a light, entertaining film that tries to build some mystery—though you might find yourself guessing a few twists before they unfold. The storyline is easy to follow, making it a good one-time watch, especially if you’re looking for something relaxing after a long day.
The star cast is decent, with the male protagonist standing out thanks to his stylish attire and polished appearance. The makeup and wardrobe choices, particularly for the main male leads, are impressive</p>
<h3>Good Bad Ugly</h3>
<p>Ajith Kumar returns to the big screen in full force with *Good Bad Ugly*, a high-octane action drama that delivers on both style and substance. Directed by Adhik Ravichandran, this film is a wild, unpredictable ride, and it’s clear from the very first frame that it was crafted with bold ambition.
Ajith plays a character split into three personas—each representing a different side of morality: the good, the bad, and the ugly. It’s a challenging role, but he pulls it off with total conviction.</p>
